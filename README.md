## About
**klein** is a small and simple [IR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_representation) that can be interpreted by a [VM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) or compiled to [machine code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code).

## Goals
- small and fast compiler.
- small and fast interpreter.
- simple and efficient machine code generation.
- small executable generated by the compiler.

## Example
Below you can see a very simple example that says `hello!` to the console output:
```llvm
@0:
	copy %0, @1
	print %0

@1:
	string "hello!\n\0"
```
As you can see above, the text format is a *little* like [x86-64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64) assembly. What this little code is doing is:
1. in `@0` label: copy `@1` label address into `%0` register.
2. in `@0` label: print everything from the `%0` address start until it sees a null terminator (0 byte).
3. in `@1` label: put a string literal into the code.

If you compile this code to [x86-64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64), the expected [machine code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code) is (using [NASM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netwide_Assembler)-like syntax):
```x86asm
_0:
	mov edi, _1
	call _klein_print
	
_1:
	db "hello!", 10, 0
```
